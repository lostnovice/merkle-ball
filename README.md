# Powerball numbers generator

```
$ python powerball.py input1 input2 input3 input4
```

## What is it?

A Bitcoin inspired way of generating numbers to play powerball with.

## What it does

Takes 4 inputs, creates a Merkle tree root hash with them (like Bitcoin transactions) and uses that hash as the seed to Python's random number generator, and gives you numbers to play powerball with.

## Why?

Quantum entanglement experiment. I was learning about Bitcoin and Powerball was like $100 million jackpot at the time. Thought I might be able to win it.
